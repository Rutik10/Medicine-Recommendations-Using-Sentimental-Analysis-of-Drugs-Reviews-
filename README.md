# Medicine-Recommendations-Using-Sentimental-Analysis-of-Drugs-Reviews-

Abstract—Sentimental Analysis has been acquiring a
crucial role in both commercial and research application as
one of the most emerging subfields of natural language
processing. Most of the work on sentimental analysis is on
Movie reviews or for an Ecommerce platform. The following
study is an attempt to investigates use of machine learning and
natural language processing for sentimental analysis on drugs
review to create a drug recommendation system framework
which recommend most effective drugs for the given condition
by analyzing drugs descriptions, patients’ condition, and
reviews which will be not only useful for patients but also for
pharmacy companies and clinicians to improve consumer
safety by assisting in reduction of medical errors. For this work
data set on drugs reviews is taken from UCI machine learning
repository our study includes text-preprocessing task such as
stop word removal, tokenization, lemmatization, feature
engineering techniques TF-IDF, bag-of-words, word
embedding, sentiment classification baseline machine learning
models Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, XGBOOST and deep
learning models N-gram, LSTM. Evaluation metrics to be
consider are Accuracy, F1-Socre and Confusion Matrix, goal is
to get data insights and drug recommendation with accuracy of
80%.

For our research, drug review dataset is
selected from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
The UCI ML Drug Review dataset provides patient
reviews on specific drugs along with related conditions and a
10-star patient rating system reflecting overall patient
satisfaction. The data was obtained by crawling online
pharmaceutical review sites.
